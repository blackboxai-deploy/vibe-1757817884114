# FLOUNDER - Remote Development Access

## What It Is

FLOUNDER is a desktop application that gives you remote access to your development environment through your phone. Install the app on your computer, generate a QR code, scan with your phone, and control your entire development setup from anywhere.

## How It Works

Download and install FLOUNDER on your personal computer. The app creates a local server and generates QR codes. Scan the QR with your phone camera and you get instant access to your development environment. Edit code, run terminal commands, manage projects, all from your phone while walking around or away from your desk.

## Current Status

FLOUNDER is fully functional and ready for distribution. Desktop app packages are complete for Windows, Mac, and Linux. QR code mobile access system is operational. Payment processing and licensing system is integrated.

## Pricing Structure

Basic access costs $5 lifetime. Pro version is $15 plus $1 monthly for updates. Ultimate version with automation scripts is $35 plus $1 monthly. One-time purchases, no recurring subscriptions for basic functionality.

## Legal Requirements

WARNING: PERSONAL DEVICES ONLY. Using FLOUNDER on computers you do not own is illegal and violates federal computer access laws. Only install on your personal machines or with explicit IT department authorization. Corporate use requires enterprise licensing.

## Future Development

Planning expansion into additional remote access tools, automation script marketplace, team collaboration features, and enterprise solutions. FLOUNDER represents the foundation of a broader remote development ecosystem.

## Technical Details

Built with Electron for cross-platform desktop deployment. Uses Next.js for the interface. QR codes establish encrypted local network connections. All code execution happens locally on your machine. No cloud dependencies or external data transmission.

## Distribution

Desktop application installers will be available for direct download. Targeting individual developers, remote workers, and mobile-first development workflows. App store distribution planned for broader market reach.

## Revenue Projections
